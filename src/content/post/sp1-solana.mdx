It's no surprise that that zero knowledge proofs are taking the crypto space by storm, and Solana is no exception. As laid out by [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs-its-applications-on-solana) there is a great need for zk technology, as zk compression on Solana could drastically improve transaction costs and speeds. Beyond the infrastructure layer, zk proofs can enable Solana developers to build the next wave of trust and privacy powered applications. Solana also has some zk native attributes, making it ideal to use for verifying proofs onchain. The only problem is that writing zk proofs isn't easy or simple due to it's ["moon math"] (link to succinct post or tweet on moon math). Even further, it can be just as difficult to verify the proof onchain once you have one. Naturally, Succinct and SP1 have solved this for the everyday Solana developer.

## SP1-Solana

Today Succinct is thrilled to announce the release of [SP1-Solana] (link to docs), a new crate extension to the existing SP1 ecosystem. With this new library any Solana developer can quickly and easily generate Groth16 proofs in Rust, and then verify the proof onchain using SP1-Solana. You can deploy the verifying program yourself or already using Succicnt's pre-deployed programs.

No need to mess with circuits or writing low-level assembly to make a proof; you can just write normal Rust as you would in Solana and avoid context switching. The library takes advantage of Solana's BN254's precompiles, giving it exceptional efficiency and speed. Integrating it to existing Solana programs takes no time at all, giving developers the best experience possible.

We're excited to see what Solana developers with build with this new library, whether it's transaction privacy, DeFi protocols, or even identity solutions. Get started today!
