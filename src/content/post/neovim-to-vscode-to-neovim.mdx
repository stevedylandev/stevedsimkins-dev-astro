Last blog post I put up here was about ways you could migrate from Neovim to VSCode, sparked by some compelling arguments and reasons to switch. I decided to make the switch for at least two weeks to see how it would go, and ended up finding some helpful tips to make that transition easier. About another week or two later, I was back in Neovim. I just couldn’t get past how clunky VSCode felt, no matter how much configuring I did. It just wasn’t the same. I didn’t like navigating through my file system through my terminal then opening it in another app. It was just so much smoother and faster to just use Neovim right there in the source. The switch did prompt me to update my config for Neovim which was good and honestly it’s never been better.

This little transition back and forth taught a valuable lesson: it’s ok to try it. Sometimes I think we become so engrained with our preferences that we’re not open to just try something different. It’s ok to try VSCode. It’s one to try Neovim. It’s not ok to use JetBrains (just kidding). Even though changes like that may not stick, they at least give you perspective and an opportunity to see what might be missing in your current setup. That’s a valuable mark in any area of life honestly, and something worth considering.

So I guess what I’m trying to say is, I use Neovim btw.

(Just use what works for you)
